# XHR Software Inc. Contributor License Agreement

Based on the Apache Software Foundation Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to software projects stewarded by XHR Software Inc. (“XHR Software”). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, XHR Software must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been agreed to by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of XHR Software and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This Agreement allows an individual to contribute to XHR Software on their own behalf, or an entity (“Corporation”) to submit Contributions to XHR Software, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to XHR Software, and to grant related copyright and patent licenses.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to XHR Software. Except for the license granted herein to XHR Software and recipients of software distributed by XHR Software, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions
    •   You (or Your) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with XHR Software.
    •   For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity, are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means:
    1.  the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,
    2.  ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
    3.  beneficial ownership of such entity.
    •   Contribution shall mean any work, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to XHR Software for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by XHR Software (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to XHR Software or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems (such as GitHub), and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, XHR Software for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to XHR Software and to recipients of software distributed by XHR Software a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:
    1.  reproduce,
    2.  prepare derivative works of,
    3.  publicly display,
    4.  publicly perform,
    5.  sublicense, and
    6.  distribute

Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to XHR Software and to recipients of software distributed by XHR Software a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to:
    1.  make,
    2.  have made,
    3.  use,
    4.  offer to sell,
    5.  sell,
    6.  import, and
    7.  otherwise transfer

the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Representation of Rights Granted

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If You are an individual, and if Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to XHR Software. If You are a Corporation, any individual who makes a Contribution from an account associated with You will be considered authorized to Contribute on Your behalf.

5. Original Work

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Third-Party Content

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to XHR Software separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here].”

8. Signature and Agreement

By making a Contribution to XHR Software, You confirm that You have read and agreed to the terms of this Contributor License Agreement. If You are entering this Agreement on behalf of an entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind that entity to these terms and conditions.

Thank you for Your Contributions!
